# Hospital-ER-Dashboard-with-Excel
Hello everyone, I analysed the Hospital Emergency response dataset from data gotten from Quantum Analytics UK.

Healthcare professionals can acquire insights into patient needs and create tailored treatments to meet those needs by analysing data such as patient waittime, patient satisfaction score, Day period, and Age group.
This can lead to better patient outcomes, improved patient satisfaction and reduced patient waittime.
